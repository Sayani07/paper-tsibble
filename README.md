## Download the data using `piggyback`

This repo includes two relatively larger (>= 50MB) data files `data/flights.rds` and `data/smart-meter13.rds`, which doesn't fit into a normal github model. You need to download the data sets using

```r
# install.packages("piggyback")
piggyback::pb_download(repo = "earowang/paper-tsibble", dest = tempdir())
```
