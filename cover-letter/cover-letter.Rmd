We have undertaken major revision on our manuscript titled, "A new tidy data structure to support exploration and modeling of temporal data," based on reviewers' comments.

We have rewritten Section 3 "Contextual semantics" and Section 4 "Temporal data pipelines". Now Section 3 gives a definition of tsibble in relation to tidy data. Section 4 describes a big picture about each module with the focus of temporal data instead of time series before.

A detailed response letter to reviewers has been provided.

We believe that this manuscript has been significantly improved, that is a good fit for the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.
